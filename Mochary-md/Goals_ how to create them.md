**Goals, how to create them**

When creating a goal, the key thing to think about is the outcome. What is the outcome, that if it occurred, you would say to yourself, “I crushed it in my role\!”?

Then you need to pick the timeframe by which you’d like for this outcome to occur.  This can be by the end of the current week, month, quarter or year.  The shorter the timeframe, the more action-oriented the updates to the goal will be. That is a good thing.  So, I tend to make my goals those that I am actually trying to complete within the next 30 days.  

And finally, you need to prioritize.  If you could only get one goal done, which would it be?  This becomes your \#1 goal.  

* I recommend never tracking more than 3 work goals and 1 personal goal.  Best to track only 1 goal however, as you will then truly focus on it.


**Next Actions, how to create them**

Once you have created goals, the next step is to create the next action needed to accomplish each goal.

Goals are outputs or outcomes.  They are occurrences that happen in the world.  

But each action needs to be an input, meaning something you have control over entirely.

Here are examples of outputs and inputs.  If the goal is: 

* “Achieve $5mm ARR by the end of the current quarter.”  
  The next action could be:  
  * “Close X customer”.  This is an **output**.  You **DO NOT** entirely control this action.  The customer must decide to buy your product.  Or …  
  * “Send a proposal to X customer”.  This is an **input.**  You **DO** entirely control this action.  

You want to **write all next actions as inputs, things that you control entirely.**  This ensures that you are never waiting on someone else to take the next action. You can always create forward momentum.

Next, you want to make the timeframe for the next action as short as possible.  What can you do in the next 2 minutes?  If you can figure that out, then you can do it immediately.  This again ensures that forward momentum is created immediately. 

Here is an example of next actions with longer and shorter timeframes:

* Send a proposal to X customer.  
  * This requires 2 hours.  First I have to write up the proposal, then I have to send it.  
  * The first 2 minutes of this action are to find and schedule the 2 hours needed to write the proposal.  So, I could instead write the next action as …

* Schedule 2 hours to write and send the proposal.  
  * This takes less than 2 minutes.  I can complete it immediately.    
  * This leads to traction and motion before even finishing your updating/planning process.

Once you write an action in a way that it takes 2 minutes or less, please do it IMMEDIATELY.   Now the flywheel of momentum has already begun.  This is the definition of BIAS TO ACTION.
