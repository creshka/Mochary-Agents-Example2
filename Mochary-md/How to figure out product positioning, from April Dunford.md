This is an *internal* exercise used by ELT to figure out the narrative on how to position their product in the market.

**Step 1:  what am I positioning against?**  
*What is the current status quo?  (Think pen and paper, spreadsheet, etc.)*  
*Who else would be on the short list of companies I have to be better than to win this contract?*

**Step 2:  what makes us different?**  
*From the status quo and short list, how are we different?*  
*(This can be product features, pricing, customer service, etc.)*

**Step 3:  “differentiated value”:  So what?  Why do these differentiators matter?  What is the value this feature enables?**  
*Go through the list.  You’ll find 2-3 buckets of “value themes” that are created for your customers.*

**Step 4:  best-fit customers:  what does this customer in particular care about most from these “value themes”?**  
*What are the characteristics of the people who care about this product?*  
*Sell them on these points.  Customers will care about different things, so having different value themes helps make the sale better.*

**Step 5:  market category:  what’s the context I position this in that makes the product value obvious to the people I’m going after?**  
*Position the value to that market category so it becomes obvious why the key decision maker should buy from you.*
